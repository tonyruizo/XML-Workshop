					The .247 avg doesn't do him justice. He is more like a .300 player,
				but I think maybe more game time is needed. For playing IF, he does a
				great job. Really quick on the feet. Hope he returns next year. Go Mallards!

					I just found this blog. I probably won't be posting much as I am too 
				busy going to the games to post about them. Seriously though... I cannot
				wait for next season. My team is already out of the running, so I wait.
